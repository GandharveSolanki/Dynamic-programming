Largest Sum contiguous subarray/Maximum subarray sum

--- suppose array is  {-5,4,6,-2,4,-1} largets subarray with max sum is 4,6,-2,4 you can solve by dp by partiton by the most efficient algo is kandanes
see simple logic and this is a very simple algorithm first of all if the postitve element are coming one by one you will always take those elements as that will
increase your sum like {1,2,3,4,5,6}  the largest subarray with the greatest sum will be the subarray itself now things change when the negative elements come into
the picture consider the eg 1,2,-9,3,4 now you traverse the array from index 0 you will get +ve ele you include in your sum now if you reach index 3 you sum till this 
index excluding the current element will be -6 now you will take the current ele as it is +ve and it will increase your sum but you will not be able to take previous sum
till now as it will only decrease the sum as it is negative -6 it is decreasing my sum why would i take it so we discard that so we discard that negative sum and only
take into consideration the positive sum we earlier got which was 1+2=3 now we start a new sum from index 3 

so simple approach whenever you see negative sum discard that and consider only the postive sum you got till now
time-O(N)
    long long maxSubarraySum(int arr[], int n){
        
        // Your code here
        int maximum=INT_MIN,currsum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            currsum+=arr[i];
            maximum=max(maximum,currsum);
            if(currsum<0)
            currsum=0;
        }
        return maximum;
    }
    
    //Another variation
    
    Smallest sum contiguous subarray
     int smallestSumSubarray(vector<int>& arr){
      //Code here
      int n=arr.size();
           int minimum=INT_MAX,currsum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            currsum+=arr[i];
            minimum=min(minimum,currsum);
            if(currsum>0)
            currsum=0;
        }
        return minimum;
  }
  just make changes to largest sum code and you get smallest sum code... vice versa changes..
